# schrodingersbox/spec_cat

This gem contains trivial matchers to make RSpecs a bit more effective and less annoying.

 * eql_file
 * have_a_spec
 * include_module
 * pass_rubocop
 * validates_with

It also provides rake commands

 * rake spec_cat:accept
 * spec_cat:coverage

 NOTE: This gem does not depend on Rails.  All paths are relative to cwd, which
 may be Rails.root or anywhere else.

## Getting Started

Add this to your gemfile...

    gem 'spec_cat'
    gem 'simplecov', :require => false
     
Add this to your spec_helper.rb...

    # Initialize SimpleCov
    
    require 'simplecov'
    
    SimpleCov.start 'rails' do
      add_filter '/vendor/'
      add_filter '/spec/'
    end


## Matchers

### eql_file

`eql_file` will compare method output to a ground truth file and fail if they
are different.

It also writes a .tmp file to replace the old ground truth if it's gone stale.

e.g.  #foo produces a gnarly string too nasty to copy and paste into spec code.

     expect(foo).to eql_file('spec/truth/foo.json')

... if it fails for a valid change, you can just....

    cp spec/truth/foo.json.tmp spec/truth/foo.json

... and all will be good again.

This mechanism is a bit brittle, but great for big blobs of data.

If you use this, you should add `*.tmp` to your .gitignore.

### have_a_spec

`have_a_spec` will ensure that any given path has a corresponding spec file to
help ensure that you have good coverage.

    expect('app/controllers/application_controller.rb').to have_a_spec

... is a good thing to write right after you integrate RSpec.

Here's an example coverage spec...

<https://github.com/schrodingersbox/spec_cat/blob/master/spec/coverage_spec.rb>

### include_module

`include_module` makes it easy to spec concern inclusion.

    it('is taggable') { is_expected.to include_module(Taggable) }

### pass_rubocop

`pass_rubcop` just executes [Rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/) and passes or fails 
based on it's exit status.

    it('passes Rubocop') { is_expected.to pass_rubocop }

### validates_with

`validates_with` confirms that an `ActiveModel::Validator` is being used.

    it('validates numbers') { is_expected.to validate_with(NumberValidator) }

## Rake Tasks

### spec_cat:accept

`rake spec_cat:accept` runs all specs and causes the eql_file matcher to overwrite
the ground truth files, rather than output .tmp files.

This is convenient when a code change impacts a large number of ground truth files,
but is also risky, as it may allow an incorrect change to become ground truth.

### spec_cat:coverage

`rake spec_cat:coverage` runs all specs and then opens the coverage report if all the
specs pass.
